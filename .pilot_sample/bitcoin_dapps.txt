### Content
Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications that run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network of computers instead of a single computer. dApps are outside the purview and control of a single authority. dApps can be developed for a variety of purposes including gaming, finance, and social media. The key characteristics of dApps include: decentralization (no single point of failure), open source code, cryptographic security, and token incentives. Popular dApp categories include DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFT marketplaces, gaming platforms, and social networks.
