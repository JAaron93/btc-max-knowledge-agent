# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing comprehensive security measures for the BTC Max Knowledge Agent's Pinecone Assistant API integration. While Pinecone provides built-in security features, we need to implement additional layers of protection against various attack vectors including input validation, data sanitization, authentication bypass, injection attacks, and monitoring for suspicious activities.

## Security Constants

The following constants define security limits and thresholds used throughout this specification:

- **MAX_REQUEST_SIZE** = 4 KB (maximum input query size)
- **MAX_METADATA_FIELDS** = 50 (maximum metadata fields per request)
- **MAX_TOKENS** = 1000 (maximum token count for processing)
- **MAX_CONTEXT_WINDOW** = 8192 tokens (maximum context window size)
- **MAX_CONCURRENT_PER_IP** = 50 (maximum concurrent connections per IP)
- **MAX_CONCURRENT_SYSTEM** = 200 (maximum system-wide concurrent connections)
- **AUTH_CACHE_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT** = 100 ms (maximum time for cached credential validation)
- **AUTH_REMOTE_FETCH_TIMEOUT** = 300 ms (maximum time for remote JWKS/key-set fetches)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust input validation and sanitization, so that malicious inputs cannot compromise the system or manipulate query results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL validate input length (≤ MAX_REQUEST_SIZE), format (UTF-8 encoding), and content against OWASP CRS patterns before processing
2. WHEN malicious patterns are detected in input (SQL injection, XSS, command injection per OWASP CRS v3.3.5 rules) THEN the system SHALL reject the request and log the attempt with confidence score ≥ 0.8
3. WHEN special characters or potential injection patterns are found (including `<script>`, `'; DROP`, `$(`, `{{`, backticks, null bytes) THEN the system SHALL sanitize using HTML entity encoding or reject if sanitization reduces confidence below 0.7
4. WHEN query parameters exceed defined limits (query length > MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, metadata fields > MAX_METADATA_FIELDS, vector dimensions ≠ expected model dimensions) THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with specific error codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive API authentication and authorization controls, so that only legitimate requests can access the Pinecone services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate API keys (32-64 character alphanumeric) and JWT tokens (RS256/HS256 with exp claim) within AUTH_CACHE_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT for cached credentials or AUTH_REMOTE_FETCH_TIMEOUT for remote JWKS/key-set fetches before processing
2. WHEN invalid or expired credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL reject access with HTTP 401, implement exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s), and log the attempt
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded (>100 requests/minute per API key, >10 requests/second burst) THEN the system SHALL implement throttling with HTTP 429 and temporary blocking for 15 minutes after 5 violations
4. WHEN suspicious authentication patterns are detected (>5 failed attempts in 60s, requests from >10 IPs for same key in 5 minutes) THEN the system SHALL trigger security alerts within 30 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want protection against prompt injection and query manipulation attacks, so that users cannot extract sensitive information or manipulate system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries contain prompt injection patterns (including "ignore previous instructions", "system:", "assistant:", role confusion attempts, delimiter injection with `---`, `###`) THEN the system SHALL detect with ≥95% accuracy and neutralize them
2. WHEN attempts to access system prompts or internal data are made (queries containing "show me your prompt", "what are your instructions", attempts to access `.env` or config data) THEN the system SHALL block and log these attempts with severity CRITICAL
3. WHEN queries try to manipulate retrieval parameters (top_k >MAX_METADATA_FIELDS, similarity threshold <0.1, namespace injection attempts) THEN the system SHALL validate and constrain them to safe ranges (top_k: 1-MAX_METADATA_FIELDS, threshold: 0.1-1.0)
4. WHEN context manipulation is attempted (context window stuffing >MAX_CONTEXT_WINDOW, conversation hijacking, memory injection) THEN the system SHALL maintain query isolation and truncate contexts to safe limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive security monitoring and alerting, so that I can detect and respond to security incidents quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log them with structured JSON format including timestamp (ISO 8601), event_id (UUID), severity level, source IP, user agent, and retain logs for 90 days minimum
2. WHEN attack patterns are detected (≥3 violations in 60 seconds, coordinated attacks from multiple IPs) THEN the system SHALL generate real-time alerts within 10 seconds via webhook/email
3. WHEN anomalous usage patterns emerge (>300% increase in query volume, unusual query patterns with entropy >4.5, geographic anomalies) THEN the system SHALL flag them for investigation within 5 minutes
4. WHEN security thresholds are breached (error rate >10%, response time >5s, memory usage >80%) THEN the system SHALL automatically implement protective measures (circuit breaker, rate limiting) within 30 seconds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data protection officer, I want secure data handling and privacy controls, so that sensitive information is protected throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing user queries THEN the system SHALL not log or store sensitive personal information
2. WHEN interacting with Pinecone THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections and secure protocols
3. WHEN caching responses THEN the system SHALL implement secure storage with appropriate expiration
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not expose internal system details or sensitive data
5. WHEN storing cached data THEN the system SHALL implement encryption at rest using AES-256 encryption with secure key management
6. WHEN exporting structured logs THEN the system SHALL automatically redact personally identifiable information (PII) including email addresses, IP addresses, user IDs, and other sensitive identifiers before export
7. WHEN a data subject requests deletion under GDPR/CCPA THEN the system SHALL provide a workflow to identify, locate, and permanently delete all associated personal data within 30 days including cached responses, logs, and metadata

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want protection against resource exhaustion and denial of service attacks, so that the system remains available for legitimate users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent requests exceed limits (>MAX_CONCURRENT_PER_IP connections per IP, >MAX_CONCURRENT_SYSTEM total system-wide) THEN the system SHALL implement queuing (max 100 queue depth) and throttling with HTTP 503 responses
2. WHEN large or complex queries are submitted (>MAX_REQUEST_SIZE input, >MAX_TOKENS tokens, processing time >30s estimated) THEN the system SHALL enforce processing limits and timeout after 60 seconds
3. WHEN repeated requests from the same source occur (>20 identical queries in 60s, >5 requests/second sustained for 30s) THEN the system SHALL implement progressive rate limiting (50%, 25%, 10% of normal rate)
4. WHEN system resources approach capacity (CPU >85%, memory >90%, disk >95%, response time >3s average) THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade service by reducing concurrent connections by 50%

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want comprehensive security configuration and hardening, so that the system follows security best practices and compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate all security configurations and fail securely if misconfigured
2. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize security-related settings
3. WHEN external dependencies are used THEN the system SHALL implement mandatory integrity verification through: (a) enforcing `pip install --require-hashes` with pinned dependency hashes in requirements.txt, (b) validating SLSA provenance attestations for critical dependencies where available, (c) performing automated SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) scanning using tools like Syft or SPDX generators, and (d) blocking installation of dependencies with known CVEs above CVSS 7.0 severity
4. WHEN security updates are available THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for safe updates
