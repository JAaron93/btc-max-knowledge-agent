# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Bitcoin knowledge agent by storing source URLs as metadata alongside article text in the Pinecone vector database. Currently, the agent can retrieve relevant information but cannot provide users with links back to the original sources. By implementing URL metadata storage, users will be able to access the original articles for further reading and verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the Bitcoin knowledge agent, I want to receive source URLs along with retrieved information, so that I can access the original articles for further reading and verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent retrieves information from Pinecone THEN the system SHALL include the original article URL in the response
2. WHEN a user asks about blockchain topics THEN the system SHALL provide both the relevant information and clickable source links
3. WHEN multiple sources are retrieved THEN the system SHALL display all relevant source URLs with their corresponding content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to store article URLs as metadata when uploading documents to Pinecone, so that source attribution is preserved with each piece of content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents to Pinecone THEN the system SHALL include a "url" metadata field for each document
2. WHEN processing existing documents THEN the system SHALL support adding URL metadata to documents that lack it
3. IF a document has no associated URL THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update existing Pinecone records with URL metadata, so that previously uploaded documents can also provide source attribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating existing records THEN the system SHALL use upsert operations to add URL metadata
2. WHEN re-indexing documents THEN the system SHALL preserve existing metadata while adding new URL fields
3. IF an upsert operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other documents

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent's responses to clearly distinguish between different sources, so that I can understand which information comes from which article.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying retrieved information THEN the system SHALL clearly associate each piece of content with its source URL
2. WHEN multiple sources contain similar information THEN the system SHALL present them in a structured format
3. WHEN a source URL is unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate this to the user rather than showing broken links
