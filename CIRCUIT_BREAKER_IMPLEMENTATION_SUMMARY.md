# Circuit Breaker Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive circuit breaker pattern for the TTS service to provide resilience against API failures and prevent resource waste during service outages.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Circuit Breaker States
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests are allowed
- **OPEN**: Circuit is open, requests are short-circuited to prevent further failures
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing if service has recovered, limited requests allowed

### 2. Circuit Breaker Configuration
```python
@dataclass
class CircuitBreakerConfig:
    failure_threshold: float = 0.5  # 50% failure rate to open circuit
    window_size: int = 10           # Number of requests to track
    cooldown_period: int = 60       # Seconds to wait before half-open
    success_threshold: int = 3      # Consecutive successes to close circuit
```

### 3. Core Circuit Breaker Features

#### Failure Rate Tracking
- Uses sliding window to track request outcomes
- Calculates failure rate from recent requests
- Opens circuit when failure rate exceeds threshold

#### State Transitions
- **CLOSED → OPEN**: When failure rate exceeds threshold
- **OPEN → HALF_OPEN**: After cooldown period expires
- **HALF_OPEN → CLOSED**: After consecutive successful requests
- **HALF_OPEN → OPEN**: If failure occurs during recovery test

#### Request Short-Circuiting
- Immediately rejects requests when circuit is open
- Prevents resource waste and excessive logging
- Returns `TTSCircuitOpenError` for blocked requests

### 4. Timeout Handling Integration
Enhanced the TTS service with comprehensive timeout handling:

```python
timeout_config = {
    'connection_timeout': 10.0,  # seconds
    'read_timeout': 30.0,        # seconds  
    'total_timeout': 45.0        # seconds
}
```

- **Connection timeout**: 10 seconds for initial API connection
- **Read timeout**: 30 seconds for TTS synthesis response
- **Total timeout**: 45 seconds to prevent indefinite hangs
- Timeout exceptions are handled as network errors and trigger retry logic

### 5. Integration with TTS Error Handler

#### Updated Error State
```python
@dataclass
class TTSErrorState:
    # ... existing fields ...
    circuit_state: CircuitState = CircuitState.CLOSED
    circuit_opened_at: Optional[datetime] = None
```

#### Enhanced Execute With Retry
- Checks circuit breaker before executing requests
- Records successes and failures in circuit breaker
- Updates circuit state based on request outcomes
- Provides detailed logging of circuit state changes

### 6. TTS Service Integration

#### New Methods Added
```python
def get_error_state(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Returns error state including circuit breaker information

def reset_circuit_breaker(self) -> None:
    # Manually reset circuit breaker to closed state
```

#### Enhanced Error Reporting
- Circuit breaker state included in error state responses
- Detailed circuit breaker metrics available
- State change logging with timestamps and reasons

## Testing Results

### Basic Circuit Breaker Test
✅ Circuit starts in CLOSED state  
✅ Circuit opens after failure threshold reached  
✅ Requests are properly short-circuited when circuit is open  
✅ Circuit transitions to half-open after cooldown  
✅ Circuit closes after successful recovery  

### Failure During Recovery Test
✅ Circuit returns to OPEN state after failed recovery attempt  
✅ Proper state transitions during recovery testing  

### Key Test Scenarios Covered
- Normal operation with circuit closed
- Failure accumulation leading to circuit opening
- Request short-circuiting when circuit is open
- Cooldown period and transition to half-open
- Successful recovery and circuit closing
- Failed recovery and return to open state
- Manual circuit breaker reset

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Resilience
- Prevents cascading failures during API outages
- Automatic recovery testing when service becomes available
- Graceful degradation to muted state during failures

### 2. Resource Protection
- Short-circuits requests during known outages
- Prevents excessive API calls and logging
- Reduces load on failing services

### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
- Detailed circuit state logging
- Failure rate tracking and reporting
- State change notifications with reasons

### 4. Timeout Protection
- Prevents indefinite hangs on slow responses
- Configurable timeouts for different scenarios
- Proper timeout exception handling

## Configuration Examples

### Production Configuration
```python
circuit_config = CircuitBreakerConfig(
    failure_threshold=0.6,    # 60% failure rate
    window_size=20,           # Track last 20 requests
    cooldown_period=120,      # 2 minute cooldown
    success_threshold=5       # 5 successes to close
)
```

### Development/Testing Configuration
```python
circuit_config = CircuitBreakerConfig(
    failure_threshold=0.5,    # 50% failure rate
    window_size=4,            # Small window for quick testing
    cooldown_period=10,       # 10 second cooldown
    success_threshold=2       # 2 successes to close
)
```
