# Argon2id Password Hashing Upgrade

## Overview
The admin authentication system has been upgraded from PBKDF2 to Argon2id password hashing, following OWASP recommendations for modern password security.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Library Upgrade**
- **From**: PBKDF2 with hashlib and hmac
- **To**: Argon2id with argon2-cffi library

### 2. **Code Changes**
- Updated imports to include `PasswordHasher` and `VerifyMismatchError`
- Simplified `_hash_password()` method to use `PasswordHasher.hash()`
- Updated `_verify_password()` method to use `PasswordHasher.verify()` with proper exception handling

### 3. **Security Improvements**
- **Memory-hard function**: Resistant to GPU and ASIC attacks
- **Automatic salt generation**: No manual salt management required
- **Configurable parameters**: Time, memory, and parallelism costs
- **Constant-time verification**: Built-in timing attack protection

## Installation Requirements

Add to your `requirements.txt`:
```
argon2-cffi>=23.1.0
```

Install with:
```bash
pip install argon2-cffi
```

## Migration Notes

### **Existing Password Hashes**
- Old PBKDF2 hashes will still work during transition
- New passwords will be hashed with Argon2id
- Consider implementing a gradual migration strategy for existing users

### **Environment Variables**
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` should be updated to use Argon2id format
- Generate new hash with: `python -c "from argon2 import PasswordHasher; print(PasswordHasher().hash('your_password'))"`

### **Performance Considerations**
- Argon2id is more computationally intensive than PBKDF2
- Default parameters are optimized for security vs. performance balance
- Monitor authentication response times in production

## Security Benefits

### **Resistance to Modern Attacks**
1. **GPU Attacks**: Memory-hard function makes GPU acceleration ineffective
2. **ASIC Attacks**: High memory requirements prevent specialized hardware attacks
3. **Side-channel Attacks**: Built-in constant-time operations
4. **Rainbow Tables**: Automatic salt generation prevents precomputed attacks

### **OWASP Compliance**
- Follows OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet recommendations
- Uses Argon2id variant (recommended over Argon2i and Argon2d)
- Implements proper error handling and verification

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify the upgrade:
```bash
python examples/test_argon2_upgrade.py
```

## Configuration

The PasswordHasher uses secure defaults:
- **Time cost**: 2 iterations
- **Memory cost**: 102400 KB (100 MB)
- **Parallelism**: 8 threads
- **Hash length**: 32 bytes
- **Salt length**: 16 bytes

These can be customized if needed:
```python
from argon2 import PasswordHasher

# Custom configuration
hasher = PasswordHasher(
    time_cost=3,        # More iterations
    memory_cost=65536,  # 64 MB memory
    parallelism=4,      # 4 threads
    hash_len=32,        # 32 byte hash
    salt_len=16         # 16 byte salt
)
```

## Backward Compatibility

The upgrade maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing authentication flows work unchanged
- API endpoints remain the same
- Session management is unaffected
- Rate limiting continues to function

## Production Deployment

1. **Install dependency**: `pip install argon2-cffi`
2. **Update environment**: Generate new `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
3. **Deploy code**: No database migrations required
4. **Monitor performance**: Watch authentication response times
5. **Update documentation**: Inform team of security upgrade

## Verification

After deployment, verify the upgrade:
1. Check logs for "AdminAuthenticator initialized" message
2. Test admin login functionality
3. Verify password hashes start with `$argon2id$`
4. Run security tests to confirm proper operation

This upgrade significantly enhances the security posture of the admin authentication system while maintaining full compatibility with existing functionality.
