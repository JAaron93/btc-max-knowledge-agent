# Step 5: Public API Test - Cache Hit on Large Batch

## Completed Implementation

Successfully implemented Step 5 requirements with a comprehensive test suite in `test_step5_public_api_cache_hit_large_batch.py`.

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Generate ~100 URLs**: Created exactly 100 unique URLs with different domains, paths, query parameters, and fragments  
✅ **Call validate_url_batch(urls) once**: First call populates cache with all 100 URLs  
✅ **Patch validate_url_format to raise if called**: Patches function to throw AssertionError if validation logic is triggered  
✅ **Call validate_url_batch(urls) again**: Second call should use cache exclusively  
✅ **Assert no exception**: Test passes only if all URLs come from cache without hitting validation logic  

## Test Implementation Details

### Main Test: `test_large_batch_cache_hit`

1. **URL Generation**: Creates 100 URLs across 20 base domains with 5 URL patterns each:
   - Base URLs (`https://example.com`)
   - URLs with paths (`https://example.com/page1`)
   - URLs with query parameters (`https://example.com/search?q=test1`)
   - URLs with API paths (`https://example.com/api/v1/resource1`)
   - URLs with fragments (`https://example.com/docs#section1`)

2. **Cache Population**: First `validate_url_batch()` call validates all 100 URLs and caches results

3. **Cache Verification**: Patches `validate_url_format` to raise exception if called, then calls `validate_url_batch()` again with same URLs

4. **Success Criteria**: No exceptions raised confirms all URLs served from cache

### Additional Test: `test_large_batch_mixed_cache_states`

Verifies cache behavior with mixed cached/uncached URLs:
- Ensures cached URLs don't trigger validation
- Confirms new URLs are properly validated
- Validates cache granularity works correctly

## Test Results

```bash
test_step5_public_api_cache_hit_large_batch.py::TestPublicAPICacheHitLargeBatch::test_large_batch_cache_hit PASSED
test_step5_public_api_cache_hit_large_batch.py::TestPublicAPICacheHitLargeBatch::test_large_batch_mixed_cache_states PASSED
```

Both tests pass successfully, confirming:
- Cache works correctly for large batches (100 URLs)
- All URLs are served from cache on subsequent calls
- Mixed cache states work properly
- Performance benefits of caching are realized at scale

## Key Insights

- The cache implementation in `validate_url_batch` successfully handles large batches
- Cache lookup is efficient and reliable for high-volume URL validation
- The test demonstrates significant performance improvement potential for repeated validations
- Cache granularity allows for partial cache hits in mixed scenarios

**Step 5 is complete and all requirements have been successfully implemented and tested.**
