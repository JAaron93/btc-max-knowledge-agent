# Path Setup Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

**Problem**: The `setup_src_path()` function was being called repeatedly from multiple test files, causing redundant sys.path modifications and potential order-dependent import issues.

**Specific File**: `tests/test_pinecone_assistant_url_metadata.py` at lines 13-14

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Centralized Path Setup
- Moved `setup_src_path()` call to `tests/conftest.py`
- Added session-scoped fixture for proper pytest integration
- Ensures path setup happens once per test session

### 2. Updated Test Files
Removed redundant `setup_src_path()` calls from:
- ✅ `tests/test_pinecone_assistant_url_metadata.py` (main target)
- ✅ `tests/test_security_middleware_simple.py`
- ✅ `tests/test_build_upload_payload.py`
- ✅ `tests/test_logging_performance.py`
- ✅ `tests/test_multi_tier_cache.py`
- ✅ `tests/test_pinecone_url_metadata_prod.py`

### 3. Added Documentation
- Created `tests/README_PATH_SETUP.md` explaining the solution
- Added clear comments in updated files
- Maintained TODO comments for future package installation

## Key Changes

**Before (problematic)**:
```python
from test_utils import setup_src_path
setup_src_path()  # Called in every test file
from agents.pinecone_assistant_agent import PineconeAssistantAgent
```

**After (fixed)**:
```python
# NOTE: setup_src_path() is now called once in conftest.py
from agents.pinecone_assistant_agent import PineconeAssistantAgent
```

**In conftest.py**:
```python
# Set up src path once per test session
from test_utils import setup_src_path
setup_src_path()

@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def setup_test_environment():
    """Session-scoped fixture for test environment setup."""
    yield
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. ✅ **No Redundancy**: Path setup happens only once per test session
2. ✅ **Order Independence**: Tests don't need to worry about import order
3. ✅ **Cleaner Code**: Removed boilerplate from individual test files
4. ✅ **Better Performance**: Avoids repeated path resolution
5. ✅ **Pytest Integration**: Uses proper pytest fixtures

## Verification

The solution was tested and confirmed to work:
- ✅ conftest.py properly sets up src path
- ✅ src directory appears exactly once in sys.path
- ✅ Test files can import without setup_src_path() calls
- ✅ No import order issues

## Future Improvement

The ultimate solution remains making the project installable:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

This would eliminate all path manipulation and enable standard absolute imports.
