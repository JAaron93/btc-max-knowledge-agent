# Security Enhancements & Production Hardening

This document provides an overview of the recent security overhaul, focusing on production-grade authentication, session management, and system resilience.

## Admin Authentication

The admin authentication system has been completely refactored to incorporate modern security best practices:

### Argon2id Password Hashing
- **Migration**: Replaced the previous PBKDF2 hashing algorithm with **Argon2id**, the current OWASP-recommended standard for password security.
- **Benefits**: Provides significantly stronger resistance to both GPU and custom hardware-based cracking attempts.

### Brute-Force Protection
- **IP-Based Rate Limiting**: A robust rate-limiting and IP-based lockout mechanism has been implemented for the admin login endpoint.
- **Mechanism**: Temporarily blocks IPs after a configurable number of failed login attempts.

### Background Cleanup & Monitoring
- **Automated Cleanup**: A resilient background task automatically cleans up expired admin sessions and IP lockouts.
- **Resilience**: The task includes exponential backoff and restart monitoring to ensure it remains active even if it encounters errors.
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive admin statistics and cleanup monitoring are available for operational visibility.

## Session Management

Session management has been enhanced with configurable security parameters and improved resilience:

### Secure Session ID Generation
- **Cryptographically Secure**: Session IDs are now generated using multiple entropy sources, including `uuid.uuid4()`, microsecond timestamps, and `secrets.token_hex()`.
- **Configurable**: Session ID length and character sets can be configured to meet different security requirements.

### Automated Session Cleanup
- **Background Task**: A separate background task automatically cleans up expired user sessions, preventing memory leaks and ensuring system stability.
- **Memory Management**: The `SessionData` class now includes memory usage tracking and automatic trimming of conversation history to prevent memory bloat.

## New Helper Functions & Internal APIs

For a detailed list of all new helper functions and internal API changes, please refer to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

### Key Changes for Contributors
- **Authentication**: Admin password hashes must now be in Argon2id format. Use the `scripts/generate_admin_credentials.py` script to generate new credentials.
- **Session Management**: Be aware of the new configurable session ID parameters and the automatic session cleanup mechanisms.
- **Rate Limiting**: Use the `get_session_rate_limiter()` helper to access the global rate limiter instance.
- **Background Tasks**: Follow the existing patterns for creating resilient background tasks with proper monitoring and error handling.
