Canonical mappings
- README.dev.md -> docs/guides/development.md
- CHANGELOG.md -> docs/changelogs/CHANGELOG.md
- docs/README.md -> docs/architecture/overview.md
- docs/development.md -> docs/guides/development.md
- docs/testing.md -> docs/testing/guide.md
- docs/security.md -> docs/security/overview.md
- docs/migration.md -> docs/migration/guide.md
- docs/architecture.md -> docs/architecture/overview.md
- docs/changelog.md -> docs/changelogs/CHANGELOG.md
- docs/guide.md -> docs/guides/development.md

Notes
- This file is informational for GitHub browsing. When additional file moves occur, add a mapping here to prevent link rot.
- For future documentation hosting, translate these mappings to platform-specific redirect rules if needed.
